The data shows that Africa has the lowest rate of fixed broadband internet subscriptions, with approximately 0.4 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. In contrast, the Arab States have the highest rate, with approximately 8.1 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.\n\nLooking at the data for individual regions, we can see that Asia & Pacific has the second-highest rate of fixed broadband internet subscriptions, with approximately 14.4 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. The World average is also relatively high, with approximately 14.9 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.\n\nInterestingly, the CIS region has a significantly higher rate of fixed broadband internet subscriptions than any other region, with approximately 19.8 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. This may be due to a combination of factors, including government investment in infrastructure and a growing demand for high-speed internet access.\n\nIn comparison to these regions, Europe has a relatively low rate of fixed broadband internet subscriptions, with approximately 31.9 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. This may be due to a variety of factors, including existing infrastructure and competition from mobile broadband services.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some outliers in the data, such as the Arab States, which have an extremely high rate of fixed broadband internet subscriptions. This may be due to a number of factors, including government support for infrastructure development and a growing demand for high-speed internet access in the region.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that there are significant differences in the rate of fixed broadband internet subscriptions across different regions of the world. While some regions, such as the CIS and Asia & Pacific, have relatively high rates of subscription, others, such as Europe, have lower rates. Understanding these trends and patterns can provide valuable insights into the state of internet access around the world and inform strategies for improving connectivity in underserved areas.\n\nCurrently, there are several ongoing efforts to improve internet access and bridge the digital divide globally.

Highest Rate of Pertussis: The state with the highest rate of pertussis in 2018 was Wyoming, with a rate of 3.6 cases per 100,000 population. This is followed closely by Hawaii, with a rate of 3.8 cases per 100,000 population. These two states had significantly higher rates of pertussis compared to the national average of 5.6 cases per 100,000 population.\n2. Lowest Rate of Pertussis: The state with the lowest rate of pertussis in 2018 was North Dakota, with a rate of 5.8 cases per 100,000 population. Other states with low rates of pertussis included Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska.\n3. Trend Analysis: A closer examination of the data reveals that there is a general upward trend in the rate of pertussis across most states, with some fluctuations from year to year. However, there are some notable exceptions, such as Montana and South Carolina, which saw a significant decrease in their pertussis rates between 2017 and 2018.\n4. Outliers: Two states stood out as outliers in terms of their high pertussis rates: Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Both states had rates significantly higher than the national average, with Kentucky having the second-highest rate of pertussis at 10.4 cases per 100,000 population and Pennsylvania having the fifth-highest rate at 12.4 cases per 100,000 population.\n5. Correlation Analysis: To better understand the relationship between various factors and the rate of pertussis, a correlation analysis was conducted. The results showed a positive correlation between the population density of each state and its pertussis rate, indicating that areas with higher populations tend to have higher rates of pertussis. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between the percentage'}

The data is organized into two categories: "State" and "New cases per 100,000 population."\n\nStarting from the lowest rate, we see that Wyoming had the lowest rate of pertussis with only 3.6 new cases per 100,000 population. Following closely behind is Hawaii with 3.8 new cases per 100,000 population. These two states are followed by several others with low rates of pertussis, including California, Michigan, Oregon, Oklahoma, New York, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, and North Dakota.\n\nMoving on to the medium-range states, we find Montana with a rate of 2.0 new cases per 100,000 population, followed by Georgia with 1.8 new cases per 100,000 population. Other medium-range states include Delaware, South Carolina, Indiana, North Carolina, and Maryland.\n\nAt the higher end of the scale, we find several states with significantly higher rates of pertussis. Leading this group is Alabama with 3.6 new cases per 100,000 population, followed by Texas with 4.2 new cases per 100,000 population. Other high-rate states include Arkansas, Virginia, Connecticut, South Carolina, and Indiana.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that there are some outliers in the data, particularly in the highest range.

Additionally, there are some notable differences between the rates of pertussis in different regions of the country. For example, the southeastern states tend to have higher rates of pertussis than the western states.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that the rate of pertussis varies widely across the United States, with some states having very low rates and others having much higher rates. It\'s important for public health officials to be aware of these variations and to take steps to address any areas of concern.\n\n'}
