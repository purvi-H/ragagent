Gold: Facebook , the world 's most popular social network , has billions of monthly active users globally of which less than three million are in China . The reason why Facebook reaches only around four percent of the Chinese population is because it is blocked in mainland China ( excluding Hong Kong , Macau , and Taiwan ) along with many other foreign social media giants like YouTube , Instagram , Pinterest and Twitter . Why is Facebook banned in China ? The Chinese government has been blocking access to Facebook since July 2009 , when a series of anti-government riots appeared in the Xinjiang province . The activists reportedly used Facebook as their main communications channel . Chinese authorities have no control over foreign social networks and see them as a threat to social and political stability , hence a long list of foreign internet sites , Facebook among them , are no longer easily accessible in China . Some people , however , access blocked websites by connecting to a virtual private network ( VPN ) . What is the future of Facebook in China ? Facebook 's most recent attempt to make a comeback in July 2018 was immediately prevented by the Chinese authorities . It is unlikely that China will allow it for as long as Facebook refuses to store its data servers within the country 's borders . Besides , keeping foreign social media banned is economically beneficial for such Chinese social networks as WeChat , Sina Weibo and Youku Tudou . WeChat , the most popular Chinese social media platform and messaging app , seems to successfully fill the `` Facebook void '' for at least a billion monthly active users .
Generated: In 2023, the number of Facebook users in China is approximately 34 million, according to the information provided in the context.

Gold: U.S. sales of most classes of medium and heavy trucks have been increasing year-on-year since 2009 , with the notable exception of class 8 heavy trucks , which have fallen sharply in recent years ; in 2017 a total of 192,000 class 8 trucks were sold in the U.S. , compared to the 249,000 sold in 2015 . In 2018 , class 8 trucks sales recovered , with 251,000 units sold . Commercial vehicle classifications Commercial motor vehicles in the United States are divided into eight different classes based on weight . Light duty trucks are included in classes 1 and 2 , medium duty trucks in classes 3 to 6 , and heavy trucks in classes 7 and 8 . The weight range for each class is not consistent – for example class 3 includes trucks between 10,001 and 14,000 pounds , class 5 is between 16,001 and 19,500 pounds , and class 7 is between 26,001 and 33,000 pounds . Sales for all truck classes – including Class 8 – are expected to increase over the short term . Global commercial vehicle market Over the last decade Chinese demand for commercial vehicles has overtaken that of the United States . Based on projections , sales of trucks over 15 tons ( class 8 ) are three to four times higher in China than in the United States , while sales of trucks between 6 and 15 tons ( roughly classes 4 to 7 ) are around 50 percent higher . However , commercial vehicle production in the U.S. is higher than in China , with the 8.52 million trucks produced in the U.S. in 2018 being around twice the Chinese production numbers of that year . When considering only heavy trucks though , production is much higher in the Asia-Pacific region than in North America . This is likely due to multiple major vehicle-producing countries , such as Japan , China , Thailand and India , being located in the region .
Generated: In the United States, sales of Class 3-8 trucks have experienced a steady increase from 2001 to 2018, with a notable spike in 2004.

A significant increase can also be seen in males , with 34.6 percent of the U.S. male population having completed four years or more of college , up from 5.5 percent in 1940 . 4- and 2-year colleges In the United States , college students are able to choose between attending a 2-year postsecondary program and a 4-year postsecondary program . Generally , attending a 2-year program results in an Associate 's Degree , and 4-year programs result in a Bachelor 's Degree . Many 2-year programs are designed so that attendees can transfer to a college or university offering a 4-year program upon completing their Associate 's . Completion of a 4-year program is the generally accepted standard for entry-level positions when looking for a job . Earnings after college Factors such as gender , degree achieved , and the level of postsecondary education can have an impact on employment and earnings later in life . Some Bachelor 's Degrees continue to attract more male students than female , particularly in STEM fields , while liberal arts degrees such as education , languages and literatures , and communication tend to see higher female attendance . All of these factors have an impact on earnings after college , and despite nearly the same rate of attendance within the American population between males and females , men with a Bachelor 's Degree continue to have higher weekly earnings on average than their female counterparts .
Generated: In the line chart spanning 1940 to 2018, the percentage of the U.S. population with a college degree reveals a steady increase over the decades, with notable disparities between gender. In 1940, the average percentage of male students in schools was 535, while the average percentage of female students was 75. By 1952, the percentage of male students had risen to 60, while the percentage of female students had slightly decreased to 6. The trend continued in the following years, with the percentage of male students reaching 185 in 1964, while the percentage of female students remained relatively stable at around 6. These findings highlight the gradual yet persistent expansion of higher education opportunities for both genders, with males experiencing a more pronounced increase in college enrollment. However, gender disparities persist, underscoring the need for continued efforts to address these inequalities and promote greater access to higher education for all.

Gold: In the most recently reported fiscal year , Spotify generated just under 6.1 billion euros in premium revenue and 678 million in ad-supported revenue . Both figures were the highest reported to date , with premium revenue having grown by more than two billion euros since 2017 . Contributing to Spotify 's success was its strong global subscriber base – as of the first quarter of 2019 , the music streaming platform had 100 million subscribers worldwide . Spotify has proved popular in multiple markets across the world , namely the United States , where more than 25 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds reported using the service . Spotify 's competition Spotify 's closest competitor is Apple Music . That said , Apple 's worldwide subscribers are almost half that of Spotify 's , despite both services being popular for different reasons . Theoretically , Pandora Radio could have presented Spotify with a fair amount of competition , but this was not to be . Pandora 's radio station format failed to match Spotify 's playlist set-up in terms of popularity , and Pandora struggled to convert its users into paid subscribers , something which Spotify has always been good at . Pandora Radio received heavy investment from Sirius XM in 2017 and was officially acquired by the company in early 2019 , so it will be interesting to see what happens in the future as Sirius gets to work on Pandora 's audience and attempts to generate cash from its arguably wide ( but unpaid ) user base . For now though , it seems that Spotify 's position remains safe .
